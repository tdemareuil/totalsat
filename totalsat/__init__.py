"""
This package is an augmented version of some modules from the `coastsat` package by Kilian Vos.
The goal was to write high-level, easy-to-use functions leveraging existing libraries, in order 
to simplify how we search for, download and manipulate satellite imagery within iPython notebooks. 
Tools available in this package include image preprocessing (remote sensing indices), labeling (to 
prepare data for ML / DL model training), slicing and other satellite imagery-related utilities.
