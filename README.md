Totalsat is a Python package to **easily download and preprocess Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5-7-8 images directly in a Jupyter notebook**. It also includes **additional satellite-related tools such as image labelling, image splitting, map data plotting, reverse geocoding, etc**.

The package is built on top of **GDAL, Google Earth Engine and the [coastsat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) library**. I developed it as an open-source project during my intership at Total in Paris (July 2020). This project **wasn't meant for production** - it's more of a quick hack to facilitate satellite image analysis. Therefore many things aren't 100% clean and could still be optimized - you're welcome to re-use and adapt everything to your needs!
